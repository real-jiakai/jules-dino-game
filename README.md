# jules-dino-game

## Introduction

This project is a clone of the popular offline dinosaur game found in the Google Chrome browser. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Players control a dinosaur that must jump over upcoming obstacles (cacti). The game features include:
*   A controllable dinosaur character with jumping mechanics.
*   Randomly generated obstacles moving towards the player.
*   Collision detection to determine when the dinosaur hits an obstacle.
*   A scoring system that increases as the game progresses.
*   A game over and restart functionality.

The game currently uses basic geometric shapes as placeholders for the dinosaur and obstacles. Future enhancements could include custom sprite graphics, sound effects, and more complex obstacle types.
